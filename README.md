# Hi, this is Anh 👋

 **PhD | Energy Technology | Low-carbon Transitions**

---

Welcome to my GitHub! I am currently a doctoral student at the Energy Systems research group at Chalmers University of Technology. My research centers on identifying and evaluating sustainable energy transition pathways in Sweden and Northern Europe. Specifically, I explore systemic challenges to electrifying Sweden’s industry and transport sectors through a mixed-methods approach. The approach includes participatory exercises, narrative analysis, socio-technical analysis, and insights from energy system modeling. 
My work combines both **techno-economic assessments** and **socio-political perspectives** from various industry and academic stakeholders. This interdisciplinary lens offers a deeper understanding of the bottlenecks and tensions in the transition process, contributing to pathways that are both effective and just. The overarching aim of my research is to foster the deployment of low-carbon energy solutions that are **technically feasible, cost-efficient, and socially just**.
